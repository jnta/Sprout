# Sprout Framework

Sprout is an educational web framework inspired by the robust Spring Framework. This project was developed to provide
hands-on training in several key areas of software development, particularly focusing on backend technologies. The
framework is designed to help understand and apply concepts such as dependency injection, recursion, graph theory, and
manipulation of request methods.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection:** Simplifies the creation and management of dependencies between different components.
- **Request Handling:** Efficiently manages various HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Graph Theory Application:** Utilizes graph theory principles to manage and resolve dependencies.
- **Recursion:** Implements recursive algorithms to handle complex tasks and operations.
- **Backend Focused:** Concentrates on the server-side logic, providing a strong foundation for backend development.

## Concepts Learned
